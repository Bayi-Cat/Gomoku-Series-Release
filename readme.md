# Gomoku-Series-Release
Archive libraries for iChess Launcher, KitOS Launcher, and Gangshen.

# Contributions
This project is developed using Python3. Before contributing to this project, you need to install a Python interpreter (the latest version is recommended).

iChess 2.0.0 and later, KitOS Launcher 1.0.0 and later, and Gangshen 1.0.0 and later versions use the json format to store user information; iChess 1.2.1 and earlier versions use the txt format to store user information.

Please abide by and maintain code standards and guidelines. If there are any ambiguities, please refer to the Python section of the "Google Open Source Project Style Guide" or consult community members.

Please use a UNIX-like system (such as macOS, Linux, etc.) for development. The community is preparing a corresponding Docker environment for developers.

# Running
For iChess Launcher, refer to the following:
```Python
python3 command.py

For KitOS (coming soon), refer to the following:
